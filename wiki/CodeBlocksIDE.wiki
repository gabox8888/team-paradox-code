= Introduction =

Code::Blocks [http://www.codeblocks.org/] is a free, open source, cross platform IDE for C++. It is a tool that can be used as one learns how to code in C++.

Currently, Team Paradox uses the FIRST provided Workbench IDE for building and transferring code to the robot's cRIO (compact, embedded, real-time industrial controller).

Code::Blocks is a useful development environment for learning C++.
