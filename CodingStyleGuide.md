C++ coding style guide for Team Paradox

# Introduction #

Paradox style for variable naming was developed by Gabe and Chris. In summary, they have a 3 letter prefix that they find useful for variable names: Flt (prefix for float), Bln (boolean), etc.

When in doubt about code style, please consult the Google C++ style guide or conform to the surrounding code's style.
